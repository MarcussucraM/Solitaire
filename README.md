Baker's Dozen Solitaire for SWE3313

Added the final version of the game as a jar file - the jar file needs to be in a folder with the card
sprites and background jpg files or it won't draw anything to the screen.


If you want to run the code from your computer you have to make sure you put the image files in the same folder
as your workspace project - whatever ide you're using.
